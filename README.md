# ROBOCON-2K18
Codes for Robocon 2k18 context -> Shuttlecock Throwing 
There are two robot we have developed for fulfilling the task of Robocon 2k18 context. One is fully autonomous and other is on manual control.
The task of autonomous robot is to take the shuttlecock from the manual robot and throw it so that it passes through the ring. And in last zone throwing angle and pressure should be so much specific such that the shuttlecock should passes through the ring and also it should landed on the golden cup. 
And the task of the manual robot is to first the lift the rack filled with shuttlecock and from passing zone it has to pass the shuttlecock to the autonomous bot without any touch. 
Both the autonomous robot and manual robot has the 3-wheel omnidrive as the driving base. Special mechanism have been maounted on the autonomous bot that is capable of recieving the shuttlecock from the manual robot and throw it through the ring. For pressure setting a special Proportionate Pressure Regulator has been taken in use. Manual robot have rack lifting, rack cluching, rack and pinion mechanism, and shuttlecock passing mechanism mounted so specifically for the fulfillment of the desired task. Manual robot is controlled via PS2 Controller. 
So, there are all the codes have been uploaded with the specific names depicting the desired task they did perform. Let's go through it.
